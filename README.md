# HashTables

# Which is a better hash function:
1. x % n where n is a large number with several factors
2. x % n where n is a large prime number
  -
# Is char values summed % 599 a good hash function for strings? Why or why not?
  -  
# Take a look at Java's HashMap class and how it produces hashed values, then describe how it works. (You may have to look at other classes to find the actual mathematical function! Follow the trail of breadcrumbs...)
